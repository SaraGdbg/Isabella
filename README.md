# About The design

**It all begun with an image of a beautiful sandy beach with turquoise water in Australia.**


This image was about to set the tone for the whole project including the design. It was used to pick the colors for our color palette.

### From idea to design

We decided to design a page for a travel agency focusing on surfing trips with destinations in Australia for girls. 

The images and the fonts are selected to fit into the rounded tones we have chosen for the page. Even the images and buttons have rounded corners to appear in a soft manner.

The menu differs between different devices; mobile and tablet have a hamburger menu to occupy as little space as possible, while desktop has a menu displayed in the header image in a suitable style.

# Creating the design

The design and graphic profile that we were provided with were very well and carefully made, which made our job much easier and faster.

We didn't really have any problems at all thanks to the design being so well detailed, and if we had any problems or we were wondering something, we always had the creators of the design ready to answer our questions.

We tried to match the original design as close as possible and didn't do anything extra because we thought it would be better or look cooler, we were provided with a design and we did exactly as it was made.
